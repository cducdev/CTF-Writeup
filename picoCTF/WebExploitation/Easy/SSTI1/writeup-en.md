## Analysis

Detailed description of the analysis process. List each step you took, your findings, and the reasoning that led to the exploitation strategy.

- Step 1: (e.g., read source / reverse binary / inspect web app)
- Step 2: (note anomalies / bugs found)
- Step 3: (arrive at exploitation strategy)

**Tip:** include commands, outputs, and screenshots where helpful.

**Sample commands:**

```bash
# e.g. open binary or clone repo
file challenge
strings challenge | head
gdb -q ./challenge
```

**Key analysis findings:**

- Finding 1: ...
- Finding 2: ...

## Exploit

Step-by-step details to successfully exploit the target and obtain the flag. Include any exploit code here.

**Main idea:**

(Briefly explain how the exploit works technically.)

**Exploit script (example Python / pwntools):**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *
# example connection
p = remote('host', 1337)
# send payload
p.sendline(b'...')
print(p.recvuntil(b'FLAG'))
```

**Steps to run:**

1. `python3 exploit.py`
2. (or) `./exploit`

**Successful output (example):**

```
FLAG{example_flag_here}
```

## Vulnerability Explanation

Briefly explain why the vulnerability exists and how it can be exploited.

- Root cause: (e.g., buffer overflow due to missing length checks)
- Conditions required to exploit: ...

---

## Mitigation

- How to fix the code: (e.g., use `strncpy` with a maximum length, enable ASLR/PIE, use stack canaries)
- Operational measures: (e.g., input validation, rate-limiting)
